title: Getting Started with C Programming
---

Hello geeks,

In this article, I am going to show you how to get started with C Programming in TurboC.

# Setup
Here's how to Setup Turbo C without installing anything on your PC.
Go to https://www.onlinegdb.com/

In the top left corner, Select 'Language' as "C (TurboC)" from the drop down menu.

By default, onlineGDB loads in some code. You can delete this code and place your own code instead.
.................................

# Basic Structure of a C Program
```c
#include <header file name>
#include <header file name>
void main()
{
............
............
}
```
This is what the structure of a C program looks like.

# Your First C Program
Let's create our first C file.

Open OnlineGDB and type in the following code.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>

void main() 
{
  printf("Hello World!");
  getch();
}
```
Now Run the program by clicking the green 'Run' button near the top of your screen.

# Explanation of the Program

**What is `<stdio.h>` ?**

stdio.h is a header file which has the necessary information to include the input/output related functions in our program. Functions like `printf` and `scanf` are from stdio.h.

**What is `<conio.h>` ?**

conio.h is a header file which is mostly used by MS-DOS compilers like TurboC. Functions like `getch()` are from conio.h and _won't work unless conio.h is included in the program_.

**What is `void main()` ?**

void main() is the entry point for execution in C program. It is where the main code of your program is written. 
_Main function is the heart of C program. Everything inside the main block will be code that is executed._

**What is `printf()` ?**

printf() is a function used to output/print text to the screen. In our example it will output "Hello World!".

**What is `getch()` ?**

getch() is a function used to keep the output from the program on the screen for some time until the user presses a key. Without getch(), we wouldn't be able to see the output of our program in TurboC as after execution the program would close.


# That Was Your First C Program
Congratulations! Now you know how to get started with C.
