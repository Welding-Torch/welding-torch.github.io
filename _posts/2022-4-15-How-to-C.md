Hello geeks,

In this article, I am going to show you how to use TurboC in just your broswer without installing anything

# Setup
Here's how to Setup Turbo C without installing anything on your PC.
1. Go to https://www.onlinegdb.com/

3. **Type Your Code**
By default, onlineGDB loads in some code. You can delete this code and place your own code instead.

4. **Run Your Code**
Run your code by pressing the green Run button or if you want to be fast, by 'F9' on your keyboard.
