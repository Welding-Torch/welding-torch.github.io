# You don't want to learn to program

You don't want to learn to program. And why would you. Programming is complex. Why would you want to learn programming? If I tell you right now "Go home and learn C, you'll maybe do that. Maybe you'll start an online course: Learn how to program in C. You'll start with the course, and write a couple of lines, write a working program. Bu what then?
I bet, that you're after a few days of doing that, you're gonna close the course, and not touch it again.
And why? Because you don't need to. It won't make a difference to your life if you do that course or not. It won't change things immediately. 
And so, you won't learn programming.

Unless...

Unless you have a goal! You don't want to learn programming, you want to make something. And the best way to make that something is THROUGH programming. You want to make an app that does something particular. You want to make a website that does something particular. You have an idea. You have a goal. And this learning programming, is a medium through which to achieve that goal. Learning programming isn't the goal, making the thing that you want is the goal. Programming is just the way to get there.

Coming back to course, if you went in with the goal of learning C, you probably won't finish that course. But if you went in with the goal of, I want to learn how to make a game, then YOU WILL STICK WITH THE COURSE. Because when you drop the course, a nagging voice in your head will tell you "But I want to make a game". I want to learn how, and I want to make it. And that voice will drive you to come back to the course and finish it. Because maybe by the end of the course, you'll have learnt enough to make your first game. That's through programming.
